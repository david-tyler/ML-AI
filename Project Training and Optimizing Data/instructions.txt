Testing different Data Augmentation techniques:
* To test the different types of data augmentation techniques there are different train_transforms provided on lines 47 - 97]
* Whichever one you pick set it equal to train_transform


Changing Optimizers and Learning Rate:
* Uncomment the line 154 to try the Adam optimizer and set the learning rate parameter (lr) to what you want to test it. 
* Then call the trainWithAdam function using the optimizer as shown in line 169. Make sure to comment other lines that are training the data to not cause issues


Using L1 Regularization:
* Comment out calls to any training methods and uncomment the line 163 with a call to L1RegularizationTrain to test
Using L2 Regularization:
* Comment out calls to any other training methods and uncomment the line 164 with a call to L2RegularizationTrain to test
